              <p>The Dutch were the first to discover our home, arriving along the Hudson River in 1642. They established this place as the colony of New Amsterdam. In 1664, England finally took over the dutch and renamed the place, New York. New York was one of the most important colonies during the American Revolution.  It passed millions of immigrants through, and you can be the next one! </p>

              <p>
               Our mission as a colony is to always be moving upwards. Hence, our motto: Excelsior! It’s Latin for higher, showing how we as a colony are always working toward being better. There is always room to improve, and that means we’ll always be moving.
