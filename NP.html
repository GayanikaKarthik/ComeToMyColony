              <p>Some of our natural resources include coal, furs, wood, and iron ore. We also harvest lots of wheat since itâ€™s our major crop. So much, that people called us the breadbasket colony with the plethora of wheat! It guarantees that you will never be hungry! Merchants can sell the flour that comes from our wheat, exporting it to England. They're partying with their riches afterward. With our coal, we can be warmer during the winters. Before we used this resource, we struggled. It was great to learn and use this resource. Our furs come from the native animals. They are usually used because of the harsh winter weather, but they are also stylish! Merchants can profit off of this by selling them back to England. Our timber helps us build better and stronger ships.
