              <p>You may not have known, but New York has more diversity than most of the other colonies! Germans, Scandinavians, French, Scottish people, English, Italians, Irish, and Croats all live in New York.</p>

              <p>Religion isn’t dominated by one either. There were  Lutherans, Quakers, Mennonites, Roman Catholics, Jews, and Puritans all living together in this colony. Settlers are entitled to freedom of conscience. This meant their religion was allowed to practice their religion privately but not publicly. This is because many of the people who settled here were the byproduct of religious wars. Many were refugees looking for safety, and the Dutch welcomed them with open arms when other Colonies pushed them away. Remember, you’re always welcome here!</p>
