               <p> Come to the New York Colony! New York City was our first capital! Itâ€™s true! New York City was the first capital city of the United States of America. It was declared in 1785. For the next five years, it was the capital of our country. Not only is New York one of the most diverse countries, accepting almost all nationalities, ethnicities, and religions! It is a safe haven for people escaping war, disputes, and other problems. Our natural resources give us so many riches that anyone can profit off! From authentic furs to our almost never-ending supply of timber! We welcome everyone and anyone. Not to forget, our colony motto is Excelsior! That means Ever Upward, symbolizing that we are always striving to be better! Many have hit success in our colony, and you could be next! </p>
